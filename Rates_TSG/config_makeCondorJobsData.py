This file allows you to produce a set of jobs to be sent to HT Condor.
The jobs will be located in the 'Jobs' directory.
After producing them, it is advisable to test one of the jobs locally before sending them all.

Example of a local test:
./Jobs/sub_job/sub_0.jobb

Submitting all jobs on batch:
./sub_total.jobb
